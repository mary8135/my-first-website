# My very first website
This is the first website I've made.
The code is not clean and nothing is very organized I know, but this was basically a playground for testing all the stuff as I was learning.

It's a simple redesign of the Mozilla Hubs landing page made with HTML and plain CSS, no frameworks and no JS.
The wireframing and design were made in Figma and the illustrations are from Bonnie Kate Wolf.
